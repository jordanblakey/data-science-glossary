                                    sought general principles of intelligence to implement, often using symbolic logic to automate reasoning. As the cost of computing resources dropped, the focus moved more toward statistical analysis of large amounts
                                    of data to drive decision making that gives the appearance of intelligence. </p>

                                <p>Also, <em>Bayes' Rule</em>. An equation for calculating the probability that something is true if something potentially related to it is true. If P(A) means “the probability that A is true” and P(A|B) means “the probability
                                    that A is true if B is true,” then Bayes' Theorem tells us that P(A|B) = (P(B|A)P(A)) / P(B). This is useful for working with false positives—for example, if <em>x</em>% of people have a disease, the test for it is
                                    correct <em>y</em>% of the time, and you test positive, Bayes' Theorem helps calculate the odds that you actually have the disease. The theorem also makes it easier to update a probability based on new data, which makes
                                    it valuable in the many applications where data continues to accumulate. Named for eighteenth-century English statistician and Presbyterian minister Thomas Bayes. </p>

                                    by falling into the opposite error of underfitting (bias). Simultaneously avoiding both requires learning a perfect classifier, and short of knowing it in advance there is no single technique that will always do best

                                    up, if the probability of success remains constant, the histogram bars will get thinner, and it will look more and more like a graph of normal distribution. </p>

                                    you can't, because on that graph they're too mixed together. Now imagine that the points are in three dimensions, and you can classify them by writing a function that describes a plane that can be positioned at any
                                    angle and position in those three dimensions, giving you more opportunities to find a working mathematical classifier. This plane that is one dimension less than the space around it, such as a two-dimensional plane
                                    in a three-dimensional space or a one-dimensional line on a two-dimensional space, is known as a hyperplane. A support vector machine is a supervised learning classification tool that seeks a dividing hyperplane for
                                    any number of dimensions. (Keep in mind that “dimensions” don't have to be <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, and <em>z</em> position coordinates, but any features you choose to drive the categorization.) SVMs have also been used
                                    for regression tasks as well as categorization tasks. </p>
